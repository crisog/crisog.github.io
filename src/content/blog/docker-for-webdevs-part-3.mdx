This post is the Part 3 of the Docker for Web Devs series. If you haven't read the previous parts, check them out first:

## Docker Multi-stage Builds

In our previous posts, we created Docker images that included everything needed to both build and run our application. This approach works, but it results in unnecessarily large images that contain build tools and development dependencies that aren't needed at runtime.

When doing multi-stage builds, we separate the build stage from the runtime stage.

```docker
# --- Build Stage ---
FROM node:22 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

RUN npm ci

COPY . .

# This assumes you are using a bundler like esbuild, 
# and no external dependencies are required other than our index.js
RUN npm run build

# --- Runtime Stage ---
FROM node:22-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# If your app needs production dependencies that aren't bundled with your build,
# you'll need to install them in the runtime stage:
# COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy only the built files from the build stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### Advantages

The build stage uses a full `node:22` image because it provides all the tools and dependencies required to compile or prepare our application. 

The runtime stage uses `node:22-alpine` because we don't need dev/build dependencies. Alpine Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution designed for security, simplicity, and resource efficiency. So the resulting image is much lighter than the full node:22 image.

This means our multi-stage build is both **flexible** & more **efficient**, because you can have different environments for building versus running the app & the resulting image is **lighter**.

#### Security
Beyond just saving space, smaller runtime images offer important security benefits. With fewer packages installed, your production container has a reduced attack surface and fewer potential vulnerabilities to patch. This is particularly important for applications that are exposed to the internet.

#### Size
A single-stage build using `node:22` might weigh in at 1GB, thanks to `node_modules` and extra dependencies. Switch to a multi-stage build with `node:22-alpine`, and that could shrink to ~160MB. 

Smaller images mean faster deployments & lower storage costs.
