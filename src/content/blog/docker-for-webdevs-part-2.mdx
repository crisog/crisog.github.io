This post is the Part 2 of the Docker for Web Devs series. If you haven't read the previous parts, check them out first:

## Understanding Docker Layer Caching

In our previous example, we've created a working Dockerfile, but it is not optimized. Docker builds images in layers, with each instruction creating a new layer. When you rebuild an image, Docker can reuse unchanged layers from its cache.

Think of Docker images like a LEGO structure, where each instruction in your Dockerfile adds a new brick to the stack:

- **Base Image Layer**: The `FROM` instruction provides the foundation plate.

- **Filesystem Changes**: Instructions like `RUN`, `COPY`, and `ADD` stack new LEGO bricks on top.

- **Metadata Layers**: Instructions like `EXPOSE`, `ENV`, and `CMD` are like decorative pieces that don't change the structure but add details

The crucial part is that Docker can only replace bricks from the top down. If you change a brick in the middle of your structure, Docker must rebuild everything above it, even if those higher bricks haven't changed themselves.

    C["WORKDIR"]
    D["FROM"]
    D --> C --> B --> A

    style B fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
    style C fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
    style D fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
`}
</MermaidDiagram>

### Cache Invalidation
Let's look at our previous Node.js Dockerfile from Part 1:

```docker
FROM node:22-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# We copy everything at once
COPY . .

# Then install dependencies
RUN npm ci
```

#### What happens if we make a code change?

<MermaidDiagram
  figureNumber={2}
  description="Code changes invalidate the COPY layer and above">
{`
graph BT
    A["RUN npm ci"]
    B["COPY .."]
    C["WORKDIR"]
    D["FROM"]
    D --> C --> B --> A
    style A fill:#4a1c1c,stroke:#ef4444,color:#E8E8E8
    style B fill:#4a1c1c,stroke:#ef4444,color:#E8E8E8
    style C fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
    style D fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
`}
</MermaidDiagram>

After making a source code change, our `COPY` instruction cache gets invalidated. And that forces the `RUN` instructions to be invalidated as well which results in the packages being installed all over again.

This is not optimal and extremely inefficient.

### Build Optimization

How can we optimize our image?

In our particular case, what we can do is the following:

```docker
FROM node:22-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files first
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Then copy application code
COPY . .
```

If you made the changes above, this is how Docker process its layer cache:

<MermaidDiagram
  figureNumber={3}
  description="Only dependency changes trigger rebuilds">
{`
graph BT
    A["COPY .."]
    B["RUN npm ci"]
    C["COPY deps"]
    D["WORKDIR"]
    E["FROM"]
    E --> D --> C --> B --> A
    style A fill:#4a1c1c,stroke:#ef4444,color:#E8E8E8
    style B fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
    style C fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
    style D fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
    style E fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#64748b,color:#E8E8E8
`}
</MermaidDiagram>

This is much better as now, unless your dependencies change, Docker will use cache for those layers and the build will be much faster!
