This series of blog posts is aimed for web devs that want to deploy and self-host their apps.

I have not fully planned it yet, but we will learn how to deploy a complete setup that includes, but not limited to:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Optimized Docker images
- Load balancing
- Horizontal auto scaling
- Observability stack
- Security practices

Very little apps are deployed this way, for a reason. You often don't need much complexity for your 0 users app ðŸ˜‚.

In these cases, it fully makes sense to use managed services like the Vercel + Supabase combo, or if you truly want a self-hosted solution you can go for Coolify (I love Coolify btw).

However, if you are looking for a challenge and have more control over your deployment, follow along this guide. I promise it'll be fun.
