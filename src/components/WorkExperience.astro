  role="Co-Founder & DevOps Engineer"
  period="January 2025 - Present"
>
  <p>
    At Rápido Tickets, I built the production infrastructure from scratch for an
    event ticketing platform handling payments, merchandise sales, and vendor
    connections. I led the effort to achieve PCI DSS V4.0 SAQ D certification for
    secure credit card processing, implementing required security controls and
    operational procedures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implemented comprehensive CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and alerting
    infrastructure for production observability. I manage databases, debug
    production issues, and maintain system reliability across multiple services
    and integrations.

<WorkItem
  company="Stateless Solutions"
  role="Principal Software Engineer, Backend"
  period="July 2023 - December 2024"
>
  <p>
    At Stateless Solutions, I led a team of 3 backend engineers & our Gateway
    and Service API platform, enabling seamless integration of verified RPC data
    from network nodes for developers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I developed a pseudo-stateless client leveraging cryptographic attestations
    and Merkle proofs for Ethereum state validation without local storage. I
    built custom ethers.js and viem integrations, including a verifiable RPC
    transport, and led development of the Stateless CLI.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enhanced system observability using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana,
    while managing GCP infrastructure for our backend services.

<WorkItem

  <p>
    At Pocket Network, I led the creation of Portal API V2, a complete Go
    rewrite of V1, from specifications to implementation. This new system,
    currently in production, has handled peak loads of 2 billion requests per
    day while reducing overall costs by 43%.
  </p>

  <p>
    It demonstrates exceptional efficiency in both RAM and CPU usage, with a 90%
    compute reduction compared to V1 and 2.5 times faster latency. I implemented
    robust metrics for enhanced system observability and reduced logging by 80%,
    significantly decreasing storage costs.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the primary knowledge source for Pocket Protocol and Ethereum, I
    advocated for transparency in our selection algorithm and drove improvements
    for fairer reward distribution. I also successfully led technical
    integrations to add $POKT to over five exchanges, including KuCoin, Gate,
    and Okcoin.
